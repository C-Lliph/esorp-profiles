# ESO-RP Profiles

### About

This is an experiment: a place for members of ESO-RP to have (almost) complete freedom to represent their characters, guilds, etc., without the limitations of BBCode. And yes, it&rsquo;s free.

There are two ways to get your own space:

1. **Link to GitHub**
   1. Message me here or [through Enjin][0] with the Enjin/GitHub username you want to link. I&rsquo;ll verify your identity by sending a random code to the account.
   1. Respond to your original DM with either a screenshot or the code in plaintext; you&rsquo;ll be given your own folder in the repo, and you can make pull requests directly.
1. **Enjin only**
   1. [Message me on Enjin][0] with a link to download your files, and I&rsquo;ll set everything up for you&mdash;no GitHub required. If you later want to get a GitHub account approved, refer to method 1.

Your custom URL will be as follows: `http://profile.eso-rp.com/YourEnjinProfileID`. For the moment, this is non-negotiable, as it makes keeping up with who&rsquo;s who much easier. This comes with a slight upside&mdash;those with custom Enjin IDs (e.g. `https://enjin.com/emmy`) will get a cleaner-looking profile link. Contact me if your Enjin ID ever changes and I&rsquo;ll get you squared away.

If you&rsquo;ve got all your files in place but don&rsquo;t see any live changes immediately, don&rsquo;t [toss the computer](https://media.giphy.com/media/kHU8W94VS329y/giphy.gif) just yet. It may take up to a few hours for everything to be updated properly, so make sure you&rsquo;ve tested what you have before sending it out.
 
### Guidelines

You&rsquo;re allowed to have as many pages and subpages as you want, with as much or as little media as you want, as many custom scripts and stylesheets as you want&hellip; Basically, you can do just about anything. Go wild and let your creativity flow. I only ask that you follow a few basic guidelines:

* Keep pages mostly related to ESO and ESO roleplay. If you want a site for your own personal, non-roleplay reasons, you can learn how to set one up using GitHub Pages [here](https://pages.github.com/).
* You must possess **all** necessary rights to any content (code, media, writing, etc.) you submit.
* All artwork, even if signed and/or watermarked, must be provided with accurate, visible credit given to the artist. (Unless you *are* the artist. Then you can do what you want.)
* Any and all NSFW content must come with a clear and visible warning. If you aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to do this, I&rsquo;ve [provided a script to generate one on a page-by-page basis](https://github.com/emmyemi/emmyemi.github.io/blob/master/nsfw.js). If you don&rsquo;t include one, I&rsquo;ll take the liberty of injecting mine for you. This policy extends to external links.
* Harmful, malicious, abusive, or privacy-endangering content will **not** be permitted. This policy extends to external links.
* Content that does not adhere to the [ESO-RP forum rules](http://eso-rp.com/forum/m/9324623/viewthread/27951247) (in summary: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dick.&rdquo;) will not be permitted.
* Do not attempt to edit the contents of any folder other than your own. While honest mistakes may happen, any edits made without the owner&rsquo;s permission will be denied.

If you&rsquo;ve found any pages that break these guidelines, or have found your content posted here wrongfully, please [open an issue](https://github.com/emmyemi/profiles/issues/new) or send a message pointing me to the content in question, and I&rsquo;ll look into it ASAP.

### Disclaimer

**I am not responsible for the *quality* of any content hosted on this repository.** While anything that doesn&rsquo;t meet the guidelines should be reported (and I severely reprimanded for allowing said content past my filter in the first place), content that is incomplete, non-working, or otherwise lacking in quality is the responsibility of each individual user.

If there&rsquo;s no contact information provided on a given page, you can always find basic info in the appropriate `userinfo.md` file included inside every subdirectory. This file will always include at least an Enjin profile link, but may also specify a user's GitHub (if relevant), and any other method of contact provided.

Please note that all content on this repository can be read&mdash;as well as downloaded, forked, edited, and mirrored&mdash;by anyone. While I&rsquo;ll be making sure everything on `profile.eso-rp.com` adheres to the guidelines above, I can&rsquo;t promise your content won't end up on a mirror repo or another website. Such is the nature of the internet. If you take issue with this, it&rsquo;s best that you refrain from submitting your content.

Finally, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub, through [Enjin](http://eso-rp.com/profile/emmy), on [Telegram](https://t.me/emmyemi), or on Discord (`Emmy#1567`).
