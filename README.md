# ESO-RP Profiles

### About

This is an experiment: a place for members of ESO-RP to have (almost) complete freedom to represent their characters, guilds, etc., without the limitations of BBCode. And yes, it&rsquo;s free.

There are two ways to get your own space:

1. [Message me on Enjin][0] with your GitHub username. I&rsquo;ll verify your identity by sending a random code to your GitHub account; respond via Enjin with either a screenshot or the code in plaintext, and you&rsquo;ll be given your own folder in the repo. (This is also acceptable the other way around.)
2. [Message me on Enjin][0] with a link to download your files, and I&rsquo;ll set everything up for you.

Your custom URL will be as follows: `https://profile.eso-rp.com/YourEnjinID`. For the moment, this is non-negotiable, as it makes keeping up with who&rsquo;s who much easier.

If you&rsquo;ve got all your files in place but don&rsquo;t see any live changes just yet, don&rsquo;t panic. It may take up to a few hours for everything to be updated properly, so make sure you&rsquo;re satisfied with what you have before pushing it.

### Guidelines

You&rsquo;re allowed to have as many pages and subpages as you want, with as much or as little media as you want, as many custom stylesheets and scripts as you want&hellip; Basically, you can do just about anything. Go wild and let your creativity flow. I only ask that you follow a few basic guidelines:

* Keep pages mostly related to ESO and ESO roleplay. If you want a site for your own personal, non-roleplay reasons, you can learn how to set one up using GitHub Pages [here](https://pages.github.com/).
* You must possess **all** necessary rights to any content (code, media, writing, etc.) you submit.
* All artwork, even if signed and/or watermarked, must be provided with accurate, visible credit given to the artist. Unless you *are* the artist&mdash;then you can do what you want.
* Any and all NSFW content must come with a **clear** and **visible** warning. If you aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to do this, I&rsquo;ve [provided a script to generate one on a page-by-page basis](https://github.com/emmyemi/emmyemi.github.io/blob/master/nsfw.js). If you don&rsquo;t include one, I&rsquo;ll take the liberty of linking mine for you. This extends to external links.
* Harmful, malicious, asbusive, or privacy-endangering code will **not** be permitted. This extends to external links.
* Content that does not adhere to the [ESO-RP forum rules](http://eso-rp.com/forum/m/9324623/viewthread/27951247) (in summary: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dick.&rdquo;) will not be permitted.

If you&rsquo;ve found any pages that break these guidelines, or have found your content posted here wrongfully, please message me here or [through Enjin][0] with the URL of the content in question and I&rsquo;ll look into it ASAP.

### Disclaimer

**I am not responsible for the quality of any content hosted on this repository.** While anything that doesn&rsquo;t meet the guidelines should be reported (and I severely reprimanded for allowing said content past my filter in the first place), content that is incomplete, non-working, or otherwise lacking in quality is the responsibility of each individual user.

Finally, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me through [Enjin](http://eso-rp.com/profile/emmy), [Telegram](https://t.me/emmyemi), or Discord (`Emmy#1567`).
