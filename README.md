# ESO-RP Profiles

### About

This is a place for members of ESO-RP to have ~~almost~~ complete freedom to represent their characters, guilds, etc., without the limitations of BBCode. And yes, it&rsquo;s free.

There are two ways to get your own space:

1. [Message me on Enjin](https://enjin.com/dashboard/messages/compose?type=user&id=11652181) with your GitHub username. I&rsquo;ll verify your identity by sending a random code to your GitHub account; respond via Enjin with either a screenshot or the code in plaintext, and you&rsquo;ll be given your own folder in the repo.
2. [Message me on Enjin](https://enjin.com/dashboard/messages/compose?type=user&id=11652181) with a link to download your files, and I&rsquo;ll set everything up for you.

If you&rsquo;ve got all your files in place but don&rsquo;t see any live changes just yet, don&rsquo;t panic. It may take up to a few hours for everything to be updated properly, so make sure you&rsquo;re satisfied with what you have before pushing it. Testing a website locally is deceptively simple&mdash;if you have a web browser (I hope you do!), you can open a raw HTML file with it.

### Guidelines

You&rsquo;re allowed to have as many pages and subpages as you want, with as much or as little media as you want, as many custom stylesheets and scripts as you want&hellip; Basically, you can do just about anything. Go wild and let your creativity flow. I only ask that you follow a few basic guidelines:

* Keep pages related to ESO and ESO roleplay.
* All content (characters, media, etc.) must belong to you, or be used with permission or otherwise within the boundaries of United States copyright law.
* All artwork, even if signed and/or watermarked, must be provided with accurate, visible credit given to the artist (unless, of course, you *are* the artist).
* Any and all NSFW content **must** come with a clear and visible warning. If you aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to do this, I&rsquo;ve provided a script to generate one [here](https://gist.github.com/emmyemi/aaa0a4ba7b5f51d5ba6298f9de708f11). If you don&rsquo;t include one, I&rsquo;ll take the liberty of embedding mine for you.
* Harmful, malicious, or privacy-endangering code will **not** be permitted.
* Content that does not adhere to the [ESO-RP forum rules](http://eso-rp.com/forum/m/9324623/viewthread/27951247) (in summary: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dick.&rdquo;) will not be permitted.

If you&rsquo;ve found anyone breaking these guidelines, please message me here or [through Enjin](https://enjin.com/dashboard/messages/compose?type=user&id=11652181) with the URL of the content in question and I&rsquo;ll look at it ASAP.

 **I am not responsible for the quality of any content hosted on this repository.** While anything that doesn&rsquo;t meet the guidelines should be reported (and I severely reprimanded for allowing said content past my filter in the first place), content that is incomplete, non-working, or otherwise lacking in quality is the responsibility of each individual user.

Finally, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me through [Enjin](http://eso-rp.com/profile/emmy), [Telegram](https://t.me/emmyemi), or Discord (`Emmy#1567`).
